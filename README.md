# thinktanks_and_media

The independence of the media and its insulation from political activity is a critical
characteristic of a healthy democracy. This paper assesses the independence of modern
U.S. news and reporting by investigating the effect of shifts in political power on media
bias in the United States. Using an event study model, we analyze whether news
publications began to cite conservative and libertarian think tanks more frequently after
the 2016 election and assess whether the Republican Party victory led to an increased
right-wing bias in the following years. Our findings show that there are no significant
shifts in media bias or partisanship over the 2014-2018 period. On the individual
publication level, we discover that the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall
Street Journal show no changes in the frequency with which they cite right-leaning think
tanks. We find similar results for topic-specific citations, with no significant changes in
bias for reporting on politics, economics, health, or education.
